# FAQ Progress

### 9/23/2017

**Initial Thoughts**: At this current moment, I don't view myself as a particularly *good* developer. I know it may be common for people to immediately jump in and exclaim, "*imposter syndrome*," but I'd like to think I'm self-aware enough to realize that:

1) I am not as good as I can be

and

2) I am not as good as I want to be

Actually, I take it all back. I am **NOT** a good developer. Not at all. I believe that acknowledging this lack of competence is the first step in my journey to getting better. I have so much more to learn. I want to improve my skillset to the point where I am comfortable with my abilities. I realize that day may never come, but that speaks more to my own mindset and mentality at this current moment. I am somewhat of a perfectionist at heart and that manner of thinking has definitely held me back in the past. I acknowledge that is an area I need to improve in as well. It's a work in progress.

It's not all bad! As someone who has been developing professionally for roughly one year, I have definitely noticed myself making progress. When I look at my work in my older repositories, I cringe at what I see. Hell, I even cringe at stuff I've written a couple of months ago. I enjoy seeing that my thinking has shifted and I have begun to think more programmatically. The manner in which I approach particular problems has evolved as well. All of that being said, I still recognize that I have *a lot* of room for improvement. I will use this directory to track my progress so I can continually see both how I am growing and how I can continue to improve. There is *always* another level. I suppose that I hope my old repositories make me cringe in the future because that would mean that I learned how to do things in a better manner. <!-- ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ -->

In this field, one thing I have noticed is there is a lot of information, I mean, **a lot**. A shit-ton is probably the correct scientific term. It is easy to get overwhelmed. This often happens to me because I keep switching without completing. What I mean by this is that I never allow myself to acquire mastery in one specific domain. I keep jumping from course to course trying to glean as much information as possible. In these attempts, I pick up a very surface level understanding of many topics, but have no deep understanding in any one given technology. I openly acknowledge that this is a dumb approach. I also understand that a feeling of mastery will not occur in a year, hell, some people may never feel like a master, but at the very least I know that I can do better. I can become more efficient. One way I will combat this feeling is by working diligently on P1xt's guides until I complete them. I also believe that pushing this out publicly will give me a layer of accountability.

I will attain the level of knowledge that satisfies me. I will accomplish what I set out to do.

In general, if you have any advice or comments, I am all ears. I really enjoy learning and growing so please share any thoughts you may have. I'm sure this seems silly to most, but I genuinely appreciate and value feedback, even if it can be difficult to hear / take from time to time. I am well aware that I will feel discouraged and dumb at many points throughout this journey. Don't worry, you won't discourage me, I've already felt that way a number of times while learning how to program. It won't be the first time and it definitely won't be the last. There is something about programming that keeps me coming back for more. I love the challenge. There will be pain and frustration, but there is an equal, if not an even more rewarding euphoric feeling when it all clicks, when you fix a bug, or when you solve that problem that was stumping you.

Seriously though, I'd like to become a better developer and hopefully help some people along the way. I would love any feedback that could help me accomplish that. =]

**Plan**: Initially, I will work my way through P1xt's FAQ guide, move on to the front-end / job-ready curriculum, and finish off by completing the more broad web dev / cs guide. I realize that this will take a serious time commitment, but time is what I currently have. I am ready to invest it properly.

Thank you,

**Update 10/9**: Today, on October 9th, I interacted with @P1xt on twitter, and she recommended that I create a Medium to post my entries on as to not get bogged down with a setup time for a more official blog. I did just that and posted a slightly edited version of this post. [Check it out](https://medium.com/@ShugKnight24/the-journey-to-become-a-better-programmer-2e57c62a3e4e)! As always, I'd love to hear what you think.

In the future, I hope to post more of my progress posts there, but I think that will be somewhat reserved for more refined posts that cover a longer time span. I do still plan on posting a lot of my daily progress in this repository.
