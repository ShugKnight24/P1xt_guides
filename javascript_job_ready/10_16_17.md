# JavaScript Job Ready Progress

### 10/16/2017

**Completed**: I again some decent progress today. I was feeling pretty drained from a grueling day at work, and an intense workout at the gym. The last thing I wanted to do when I got home was look at code and make my brain have to think. I played around with Scratch for a little bit, but I could not focus for very long. I was able to relax for a bit and then got into fooling around in Scratch for about an hour.

**Thoughts**: The last couple of days have definitely been rough. I've been making a lot of progress on work related projects, but not as much on things I've been doing outside of work. I need to find a good balance between the two. I made decent progress on the game I am making, but I want to make the costumes of the sprites better and improve some of the logic before I submit it. I'll see if I can improve on it tomorrow.

I would ask for feedback, but I didn't really make enough progress to truly warrant any. Let me know if you have any thoughts regardless. I'd appreciate them.

Until [next time](10_17_17.md),
