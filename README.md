# P1xt Guide Progress

**Note**: I will be using this GitHub Repo to track my progress going through [P1xt's guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides). I think she beautifully lays out a method and plan that any programmer can follow to grow and develop their skills.

Tentative To-Do:

- [ ] I will start with the [FAQ Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/faq.md)
- [ ] Move to [Javascript Job Ready](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready-javascript-edition-2.0.md)
  - Formerly it was, [Job Ready Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md)
- [ ] Finish with [Web Dev / CS Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md)

I will be updating my progress with the FAQ guide in [FAQ Progress](faq_progress/faq_progress.md).

  - My first post is on [9/23](faq_progress/9_23_17.md).

I will be updating my progress with the Javascript Job Ready guide in [Javascript Job Ready](javascript_job_ready/javascript_job_ready.md).

  - My first post is on [10/1](javascript_job_ready/10_01_17.md).
