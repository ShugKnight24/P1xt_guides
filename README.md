# P1xt Guide Progress

**Note**: I will be using this GitHub Repo to track my progress with [P1xt's guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides). I think she beautifully lays out a method that any programmer can use to continue to grow and develop their skills.

Tentative To-Do:

- [ ] I will start with the [FAQ Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/faq.md)
- [ ] Move to [Job Ready Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md)
- [ ] Finish with [Web Dev / CS Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md)

I will update my progress in [Progress](progress.md)
