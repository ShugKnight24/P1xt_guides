# P1xt Guide Progress

**Note**: I will be using this GitHub Repo to track my progress going through [P1xt's guides](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides). I think she beautifully lays out a method and plan that any programmer can follow to grow and develop their skills.

Tentative To-Do:

- [ ] I will start with the [FAQ Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/faq.md)
- [ ] Move to [Job Ready Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md)
- [ ] Finish with [Web Dev / CS Guide](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/wd-cs.md)

I will be updating my progress with the FAQ guide in [FAQ Progress](faq_progress/faq_progress.md).
